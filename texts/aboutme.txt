          My name is Kevin Liu, and I am currently a student and aspiring Software Engineer 
          pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Maintaining a GPA of 3.94/4.00, 
          I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, C, and C++, and I am proficient with various tools and libraries including React.js, Docker, and AWS. 
          Throughout my academic career, I have engaged in several impactful projects and research initiatives, allowing me to apply and expand my technical skills in practical settings.

          One of the most significant experiences in my academic journey was serving as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Argonne National Laboratory. 
          There, I conducted a comprehensive performance benchmark analysis for MPICH's SMP Broadcast algorithm, providing critical insights into design efficiency and potential performance enhancements. 
          Additionally, my role as a Research Software Engineer at the Illinois Mathematics Lab involved developing a web-based game using React.js to explore counterexamples to the Kaplansky conjectures, 
          showcasing my ability to combine software development with advanced mathematical concepts. 
          Furthermore, as a Course Associate/Assistant for CS124, I facilitated learning for over 1200 students, developed code walkthroughs, and mentored new staff members, 
          demonstrating my commitment to academic excellence and leadership. These diverse experiences have not only honed my technical expertise but also strengthened my leadership and communication skills, 
          equipping me for future contributions in the fields of mathematics, software engineering, and computer science.
